Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet , with one lawmaker saying that Chile 's claim that the former Chilean dictator has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous .
In 1997 , seven years after Pinochet left power , Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile , followed closely by Britain .
British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request from Spain , which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973 .
Pinochet , 82 , was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge .
