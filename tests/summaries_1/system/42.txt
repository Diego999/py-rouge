A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap , killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180 in Sweden 's second-largest city .
The worst previous fire disaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 in Boraas , when 20 people died in a hotel fire .
Forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able Saturday to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire , but the catastrophe 's most tormenting question was still unanswered .
On Saturday , hundreds of people stood quietly outside the gutted building amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come to grips with catastrophe .
