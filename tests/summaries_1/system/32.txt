TRIPOLI , Libya _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie , Scotland .
Libya 's justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of Western politics when they go on trial .
Libya has accepted in principle to a trial before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands .
But the hand over of the suspects has been held up over Libya 's demand for a guarantee that the two men , if convicted , will be jailed in Libya .
