Facing a court challenge , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold , at least temporarily , the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa 's last apartheid-era president , F.W. de Klerk , in illegal acts .
President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated human rights during apartheid , setting him at odds with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South Africa .
The disagreement stems from Thursday 's release of the report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during apartheid .
