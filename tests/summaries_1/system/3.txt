The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden , the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa , according to U.S. intelligence officials .
The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States , but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law .
The Taliban , who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan , on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States .
