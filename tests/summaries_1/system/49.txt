James Kopp , the man the FBI is seeking as a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian , is known to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester , and law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics .
Robert Behn , one of the protest leaders , even spent two hours talking about abortion over breakfast last year with Slepian .
Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder their efforts .
Slepian often expressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after abortion .
