Congress has passed only six of the 13 required spending bills and are negotiating now with the White House on a final omnibus package that will contain the remaining seven bills and major issues including how to conduct the census in the year 2000 , how much money to provide the International Monetary Fund and under what conditions it should be provided , and how much emergency money to provide for items like increased security at U.S. embassies around the world and for American farmers .
If Republican leaders can not count on their conservatives , they will need support from Democrats to pass the final package .
