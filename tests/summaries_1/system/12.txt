The leaders of Malaysia 's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim , who faces trial next month in a case that will test the country 's legal system .
At a series of rallies before his arrest , Anwar led throngs in chanting for Mahathir 's resignation and a more open , less corrupt government .
Mahathir and Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader .
The Philippine leader said he was considering skipping a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia in November to protest the arrest of Anwar , whom he described as a personal friend .
