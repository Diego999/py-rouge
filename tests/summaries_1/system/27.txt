The reported talks between Exxon , whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General Electric , and Mobil , the No. 2 U.S. oil company , come as oil prices have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 years .
Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey , and Mobil consisted of two companies : Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil .
Exxon and Mobil confirmed Friday that they were discussing ways to combine .
Shares of Exxon , the biggest U.S. oil company , rose $ 1.6875 , or 2.3 percent , to $ 74.375 .
Companies of Mobil 's size are probably marginal players .
Q. That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the downturn in prices .
