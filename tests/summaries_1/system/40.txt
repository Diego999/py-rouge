Last weekend , the Palestinians inaugurated an airport in the Mediterranean city of Gaza under the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord which envisages Israel ceding more lands to the Palestinians in return for security guarantees .
Until now , Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv .
Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport .
Israel 's government does not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian airport , citing security reasons .
Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport .
