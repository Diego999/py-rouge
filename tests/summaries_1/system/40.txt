Turkey 's latest premier-designate got the backing of two key secular parties Monday in his efforts to form a broad-based , coalition government , on condition that his government stick to Turkey 's secular principles .
Ecevit , who was asked to form a new government Wednesday , desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier Tansu Ciller 's center-right party .
Ecevit , a veteran leftist , already has the support of another center-right party led by Mesut Yilmaz , whose government collapsed last week under the weight of a mafia scandal .
Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government .
