More than five years of severe food shortages and a near-total breakdown in the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in North Korea and probably left an entire generation of children physically and mentally impaired , a new study by international aid groups has found .
North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages , having harvested only 3 million tons of grain this year , about two-thirds of the minimum needed by its 23 million people .
Famine-threatened North Korea 's harvest will be no better this year than last and could be worse , a senior U.N. aid official said Saturday .
