Jose Saramago , a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States , was awarded this year 's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm .
The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel , the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite .
The prizes have been awarded since 1901 ; a sixth prize , in economics , was started in 1969 .
The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday , the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday .
