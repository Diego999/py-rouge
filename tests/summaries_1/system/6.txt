Israel 's Cabinet announced within hours of a market bombing Friday that it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism .
One of Israel 's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to fight attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets .
The Palestinians , however , said the two bombers had come from Israeli-controlled areas and that Israel thus bore at least part of the security responsibility for the attack .
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the market bombing and vowed more attacks to try to block the new peace accord .
