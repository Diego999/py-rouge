More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during the management lockout , a long-awaited arbitrator 's decision that may affect leverage in the league 's dispute with the players and have major ramifications on American sports-labor law .
But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator , John Feerick , to speed up negotiations , especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players , an award that could approach $ 800 million in salaries .
A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners .
