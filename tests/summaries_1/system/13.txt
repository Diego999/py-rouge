House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who orchestrated the Republican revolution of recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton , was driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday 's midterm elections .
Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seats , it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority .
Winning control of Congress after so many years was very tough for Gingrich in 1994 .
For the past year , Republicans struggled to keep control of the House with a 228-207 majority and to find consensus among their party 's competing factions .
