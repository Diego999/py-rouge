King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia 's top political leaders , saying the meeting would not bring any progress in deadlocked negotiations to form a government .
Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen 's party to form a new government failed .
Hun Sen 's ruling party narrowly won a majority in elections in July , but the opposition _ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government .
