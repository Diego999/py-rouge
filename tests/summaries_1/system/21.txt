Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station , the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle .
In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm , two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together .
The bigger worry , by far , was over Endeavour 's pursuit and capture of Zarya , and its coupling with Unity .
The shuttle 's 50-foot robot arm had never before been assigned to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya , a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20 .
