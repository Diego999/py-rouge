Russia 's Zarya , or Sunrise , module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour , which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module .
Zarya , built in Russia with $ 240 million from the United States , is to be joined in two weeks by the first American module , a docking hub called Unity .
The bigger worry , by far , was over Endeavour 's pursuit and capture of Zarya , and its coupling with Unity .
The shuttle 's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot , 44,000-pound Zarya , a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on Nov. 20 .
