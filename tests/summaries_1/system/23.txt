Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis .
Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from an upper respiratory infection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius .
The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no serious health problems and will serve out the final two years of his term .
Yeltsin is still planning to go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nations , the president 's office said .
