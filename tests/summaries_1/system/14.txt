One of the government 's allegations in the antitrust suit is that Microsoft won out over Netscape as the main browser for AOL because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly as a bargaining chip .
The much smaller Netscape would be placed under the wing of AOL and Sun Microsystems .
AOL , according to executives close to the proposed deal , will own Netscape , but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun .
As part of the deal , AOL will agree to purchase about $ 300 million worth of Sun 's computers for its service , while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable amounts of Netscape software , which Sun 's sales force must sell .
