Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services.
Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could be a strong partner for AOL in the market for Internet commerce software.
AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business.
America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executives involved in the talks said Sunday.
The stock closed Friday at $39.1875, up $2.625.
