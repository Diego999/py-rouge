Brazil, the continent's largest economy and a potential bulwark against creeping recession, is waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.
The news comes as the United States and the IMF complete a bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through Asia, Russia and several other nations.
The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion.
