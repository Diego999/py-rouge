Yeltsin has decided to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur because it deals mostly with financial issues, Yeltsin's office said.
Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday and his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be in the office all week.
Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said.
The court will take at least a week to consider the issue, the Interfax news agency reported.
