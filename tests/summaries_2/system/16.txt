Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey.
Syria claims the ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.
Turkey accuses Syria of harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast; it says rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan lives in Damascus.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the dispute which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels.
