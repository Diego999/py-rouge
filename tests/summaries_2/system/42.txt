A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials said Saturday.
Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. -LRB-2243 GMT-RRB- Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue workers said.
The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where the dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant association in Sweden's second-largest city.
About 180 people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in intensive care.
