Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official said Saturday.
Thailand showed its nearly complete facilities for the Asian Games to a tough jury Thursday _ the heads of the organizing committees from the 43 nations competing in the December event.
With the addition of snooker, the Asian Games now have 36 sports.
The Bangkok games are expected to attract more than 10,000 athletes from 43 nations.
Estimates of the number of female sex workers in Thailand, a country of 60 million, range from more than 300,000 to 2 million.
The Asian Games are held every four years.
