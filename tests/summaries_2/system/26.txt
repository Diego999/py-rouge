Turkey wants Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe.
The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last week in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers Party PKK, Zehetmayr said.
He leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Ankara counters that Greece is harboring PKK ``terrorists.''
Turkey has asked for Ocalan's extradition.
