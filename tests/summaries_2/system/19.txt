The head of the European Central Bank that will set monetary policy for the euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday suggested governments should reform rigid labor markets to create jobs, and not pressure him to cut rates.
Initially, the currency will group 11 European nations in a euro zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece on the outside.
Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent.
The poll, conducted Dec. 18-22, was broadcast by TV2 channel.
