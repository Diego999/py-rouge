The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack, which led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security accord signed with the Palestinians last month, were identified as members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli security control.
The militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War said Saturday that it carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, which prompted arrests by the Palestinian Authority overnight.
Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, said the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack.
The young man, once an ace student, had come of age in Israeli prisons.
