The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegations of corruption within the Olympic movement.
Samaranch said Hodler should have brought his allegations first to the IOC executive board.
Helmick eventually resigned both as an IOC member and as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
Under current rules, all IOC members have a vote.
