The United States and North Korea are set to resume talks Friday about inspections of an underground North Korean site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons.
``We've made clear to the North Koreans that any attempt by North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development program would be unacceptable,'' the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said.
Kim, who has moved South Korea to a ``sunshine'' policy of engaging North Korea on cultural and economic fronts, firmly said his government supports Clinton on the nuclear issue.
The North Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear weapons.
``We need access to it.''
