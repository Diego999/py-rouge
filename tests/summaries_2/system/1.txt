The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people.
After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the 350-mile-wide -LRB-560-kilometer-wide-RRB- storm had moved slightly to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast.
Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland communities.
The 350-mile -LRB-560-kilometer-RRB- wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph -LRB-12 kph-RRB-.
