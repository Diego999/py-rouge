Two yacht crew members are dead, three yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet.
With winds gusting to 80 knots and seas swelling to 10 meters -LRB-35 feet-RRB-, the race continued even as rescue teams searched for the three missing yachts.
