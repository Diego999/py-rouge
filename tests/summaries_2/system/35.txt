Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new government.
The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition.
He will have similar problems passing the 1999 budget, which is necessary before Italy can cut its lending rates, a requirement for joining the single European monetary unit, the euro, on Jan. 1.
