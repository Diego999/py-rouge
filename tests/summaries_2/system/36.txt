Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British government agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation on the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but a longer firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security forces, the Interfax news agency said.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been recovered.
